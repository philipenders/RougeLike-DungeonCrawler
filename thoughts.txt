So yeah.

- Engine
    *The menus (load into the game, change settings if applicable, etc.)
    *Once the game starts, the engine: wait for key inputs -> update the game state
    *redraw the screen whenever the game state updates(key input)
    *the engine should be able to take in a GameState Object, and then render based on that GSO.

-GameState Object
    *functional or state-based? not a huge deal, but have to decide
    *it likely contains what level # you're on, where player is, where enemies/objects/obstacles are.
    * Player Object + list of Enemy Objects
    * Contains the map (maybe a small subobject, called worldorsomething)

-Class Player
    *Inventory
    *other attributes

-Class NPC

-Class Enemy (either config or subclass)

-Class Item

(Main loop orbably maintains a gamestate or the engine.  And on whichever of those,  there would be an "UpdateState" function
or method and the engine would decide what to do depending on keys pressed.


-Ideas
    *City - various levels, the city("safe"), the sewers(Easy levels), the labyrnth(goblins are more active), the goblinholm(look at the name)
    - City
        *Merchants for various things (basic to advanced, weapons, tools, etc.)
        *maybe minor side quests (eventually)
        *beacons get placed around the city, so you need to put the gems in the right places
        *last adventurer- all the others have died, so the town has basically given up.
        *overworld plot (later)

-Hacklike
    *as you go down, the levels go down, but as you go down it remembers where you've been.


-Bandlike
    *top levels are consistent

0.1 our first goal:
    - There is a city at the top small, one screen.
    - level generator
    - the city should have a shop
        *The shop sells, upgrades to your sword, pack, armor, boots!, hats.
    - one dungeon underneath, 20 levels long
    - chests in the dungeon, 1 contains beacon in each level, 1 chance to contain loot
    - the city pays you for placing beacons, especially in case the dungeon didn't give good loot. (shop will buy loot)
    - all loot items must have a "value"
    - Combat (adjacent including diagonals)
    - Order of Resolution: Player, then everything else
    - To get the last Crystal you must fight the Orc Captain

    to decide:
        * What traits / attributes players/monsters have
        * What item/inventory exist/ what kind of things there are.
            -weapon slot, pack, armor, boots!, misc 1, misc 2
            -weapons, bags, armor, boots!, misc_wearables, misc_other, beacons, nazi_scalps, potion
        *A beastiary (goblins, orcs, rats, etc.)


future versions
  -snake oil (everyone loves the smell of snake oil, and the more you rub on yourself, the better prices get)
  -controls screen

  For next time we meet,  finalize what we want for attributes on the players, enemy attributes, what our beasiary is, and what items we want
  20 items max, 3 enemies,  easy, less easy, boss,

 beastiary
 items
  shortdescription, verbosedescription, stats n stuff
